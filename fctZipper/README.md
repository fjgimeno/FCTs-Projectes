## FCTZipper

This app is pretty much self explanatory.

Run with any args and it will run as unzip, run it without args and it will run as zip.

Example of how you should execute the app once the jar has been built:

	java -jar .\FCTZipper.jar somerandomstuff		/*Unzips*/
	
	java -jar .\FCTZipper.jar						/*Zips*/
	
In case of compressing a file, the resulting file will generate at the parent folder of the one selected on the programm execution.
